# easter-project

This is a work in progress, using the double diamond design process.

Problem statements:

    Anusha wants to DJ at parties
    Because then she won't need as many Djs
    But does not have an organised music collection or does not have an in-depth knowledge of her collection

    Anusha wants to organise her music collection
    Because she Djs at parties
    But listening to all her collection is time consuming

    Anusha wants to visualise songs
    because it might provide a quick way to decide whether they are good to be played in the same set
    But she does not have a way to do so
    

Selected Statement:

    Anusha wants to DJ at parties
