This is a work in progress, using parts of the [double diamond design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)).


Insight statements:

    Anusha wants to DJ at parties
    Because then she won't need as many Djs
    But does not have an organised music collection or does not have an in-depth knowledge of her collection

    Anusha wants to organise her music collection
    Because she Djs at parties
    But listening to all her collection is time consuming

    Anusha wants to visualise songs
    because it might provide a quick way to decide whether they are good to be played in the same set
    But she does not have a way to do so
    

Selected Statement:

    Anusha wants to DJ at parties
    Because then she won't need as many Djs
    But does not have an organised music collection or does not have an in-depth knowledge of her collection

How might we:
 - help Anusha to understand the songs in her collection?
 - help Anusha leverage the data in her music collection?
 - help Anusha to play songs without understanding her whole music collection?
 - help Anusha to avoid playing crap songs?
 - help Anusha to understand which songs to play next?
 - help Anusha to organise her music collection?
 - help Anusha to get to know her music collection?
